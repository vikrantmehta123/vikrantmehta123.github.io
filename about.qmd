Hi, I'm VikrantðŸ‘‹. 

I'm an Arts graduate (B.A. in Psychology) who loves computer science. To that end, I am pursuing an online B.S. in Data Science from IIT Madras while working in the big data team at **VuNet Systems**, Bangalore. 

Understanding what's *under the hood* is a joy to me.

I strongly believe books are closest things to magic in the world of muggles. Beyond computers and the human mind, I love tennis, theatre, and finance. 

I write about what I read, the projects I'm building, and the amazing people that I meet.
