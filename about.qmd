Hi, I'm VikrantðŸ‘‹. 

I am an Arts graduate (B.A. in Psychology) who loves computer science. To that end I am pursuing an online B.S. in Data Science from IIT Madras. I currently work in the data science team at VuNet Systems, Bangalore. 

I like building things from scratch. I love sports, theatre, and finance. I play chess, tennis, and cricket. I'm an avid reader and I write about what I read, the projects I'm building, or the amazing people that I meet.
