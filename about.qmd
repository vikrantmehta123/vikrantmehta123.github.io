Hi, I’m Vikrant👋.

I studied Psychology and completed my B.S. in Data Science from IIT Madras. I currently work in the Big Data team at VuNet Systems, Bangalore.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and theatre. And I strongly believe books are closest things to magic in the world of muggles.

Here, I share what I'm reading, projects I'm building, and lessons I'm learning along the way.
