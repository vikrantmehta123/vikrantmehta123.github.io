ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vikrant Mehta. Iâ€™m a final-year student at IIT Madras, pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and Applications. I currently work as a teaching assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms (PDSA) course and as a Software Engineering intern at VuNet Systems in Bangalore. I'm passionate about applying Data Science to various domains and am always eager to explore new ideas and learn.

Outside of academics, I try to keep my interests broad. I love sportsâ€”I play chess, tennis, and cricket. Iâ€™m an avid reader, aiming to finish at least one book each week, and I also enjoy studying finance. I usually write about what I read, intriguing finance topics, projects I'm building, or new things Iâ€™m learning.

Iâ€™m a bit of a techie who loves data science and programming but finds joy in other fields too. My interests span beyond tech, including finance, sports, languages, and even theatre.
