Hi, I'm VikrantðŸ‘‹. 

I am an Arts graduate (B.A. in Psychology) who loves computer science. To that end, I am pursuing an online B.S. in Data Science from IIT Madras while working in the big data team at VuNet Systems, Bangalore. 

Knowing what's *under the hood* is a joy to me. Building things from scratch is my kind of fun.

Beyond computers, I love sports, theatre, and finance. You'll often find me playing chess or tennis. I strongly believe books are closest things to magic in the world of muggles.

I write about what I read, the projects I'm building, or the amazing people that I meet.
