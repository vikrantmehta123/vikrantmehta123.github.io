:::{#hero-layout}

Hi, I'm VikrantðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a final-year student at IIT Madras, pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and Applications. I currently work as a Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms (PDSA) course and as a Software Engineering intern at VuNet Systems in Bangalore.

Outside of academics, I love sports, theatre, and finance. I play chess, tennis, and cricket. I'm an avid reader, and I write about what I read, projects I'm building, or my learning journey.
