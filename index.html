                <p>Hello! My name is Vikrant. I just finished my Bachelor's in Psychology and now I'm diving into Data Science with a BS from IIT Madras.  
                    I like Machine Learning and have experience with programming languages like Python, C#, Java, 
                    and web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
                    I find coding to be a fun way to bring my ideas to life. 
                    In my free time, I  like to read, travel and play cricket or tennis.

                <p> When I was doing BA Psychology, I did a small self project of interviewing business owners who had inspiring stories to tell. I conducted more than 20 such interviews, and wrote a few articles on them. Here are a select few:</p>

                                Dad, a schizophrenic, with a minuscule salary of 700₹ per month; mom, a cancer patient; elder brother, deceased from a dog bite reaction; home at a place which was dominated by Naxalite activities, Gondia. With this as his background, came the light of the Bhatia family- Bhavesh. </p>
                                <p class="card-text read-more-text">
                                <img src="" alt="Personal Photo with Bhavesh Bhatia">
                                Bhavesh's childhood was a continuous struggle. Yet, he had a hankering for adventures. 
                                'मुझे adventures पसंद है। ( I love adventures.) In the 8th grade, I made a friend, who had an amputated leg. After finishing our 10th grade, we made a trip from our hometown to Kathmandu, Nepal- a distance of 5,620 km- on bicycle. I had to do the pedalling. He had to do the handling.'
                                And together, they managed their riding. The ride was to make an identity of his own, to prove himself to the world. Proved himself, he did. He was welcomed like a hero in his hometown.
                                'गाँवसे २०-३० km बाहर, ४००-५०० लोग welcome करने आए थे।' ( There were 400-500 people outside my town to welcome me.)
                                But the euphoria of success didn't last long. <br> <br>
                                Soon after returning, his mother was taken seriously ill with stage IV blood cancer. 
                                'घर, ज़मीन , जो भी बचाया था, सब बेच दिया। दोस्तों , रिश्तेदारों से जितना हो सके उतना क़र्ज़ा लिया। ( We sold everything we had and took out as much loan as we could for her treatment.) But fate operates on her own accord. We lost her, regardless of our efforts.' 
                                Bereft of a great loving support, left alone with a relapsed dad, he was now an unemployed double graduate. This is how Bhavesh's life stood in the early 1990's.
                                'माँ चली गयी, पर मैं और daddy बिल्कुल footpath पर आ गए| ( Mom left us but me and dad were on the streets.)' <br> <br>
                                'I had a master's degree in Psychology and Economics, yet I was without a job. To be honest, I didn't want to do a job; I wanted to do business. But what business could I do back then? There was none. I had to find a job. I worked as a telephone operator for a while, 18-20 hours a day for a handful of coins. Later, I got trained as a massage therapist. In fact, I was awarded 'The Best Massage Therapist in Maharashtra' award. I worked day and night; I worked till my hands were swollen and somehow managed to save 5,000₹.'
                                These hard earned 5,000₹ were put to the best use possible. <br><br>
                                Bhavesh learned a skill- candle making- a skill that would transform his life. With the 5,000₹, he bought 20 kg of wax and a simple candle die for raw material. Thus, he embarked on his dream of starting a business. His manufacturing unit? A single wooden table. His retail store? A rented handcart. The name registered- Sunrise Candles. The year was 1994 and the place, Mahabaleshwar. <br> <br>
                                'Back in the day, candles worth thousands of crores were imported from countries like China. Even today, the scenario hasn't changed much. It was obvious that there was a tremendous opportunity in the candle business, especially in the 'fancy' candle business. And Mahabaleshwar, being a tourist destination, played to my advantage.'
                                Bhavesh's mornings became reserved for manufacturing candles and his evenings, for selling them. 
                                He started with plain candles but soon, he was designing fancy candles. Within the first few years, he had created thousands of beautiful designs. 
                                'People used to come to my handcart and fall in love with what I was doing. They would buy a few candles, and then send more people to my handcart. On my handcart came tourists who were specialists in business. They helped me with marketing, packaging, sales, and whatnot. The business grew in this way.'
                                Yet, there was the sword of debt hanging over his head. <br> <br>
                                'We knew that if we wanted to expand, we had to reach outside Mahabaleshwar. So we started taking part in exhibitions. At one such exhibition, there came a couple who worked at Infosys. It was their wedding anniversary. I gave them a small gift from my side. They were so impressed that they invited me to stay at Infosys for three days and mailed all the 25,000 employees of Infosys to encourage them to buy my products.'
                                It's miraculous what a small act of kindness can do. A 60₹ gift brought in a business of 23 lakhs. The whole debt was paid off, with interest. <br> <br>
                                By now, Bhavesh was employing about 30 people. The production was now far exceeding the selling capacity of a handcart. He had to find more places to sell his candles. Again, the tourism value of Mahabaleshwar came to the rescue. 
                                'A few hoteliers were now willing to put up a small selling unit of ours at their hotels. By now, even we'd understood where we should sell the candles, you know, tourist places and such. We put up our stall wherever we got the opportunity and the whole ownership of the stall was given to the guy running it. We could expand even more in this way. More than a thousand corporates are now associated with us including the Taj Group and Grand Hyatt Group.'
                                His business now ran smoothly. Yet, the hunger for adventures wouldn't let him sit still. He took up mountaineering. <br> <br>
                                'अगर आपको कभी trekking वगैरे करना हो, तो आओ हमारे साथ। ( If you want to go on a trek, join us.) I have just finished climbing Kilimanjaro, and my dream is to climb Mount Everest. It's, like, a real bucket list item.' <br> <br>
                                With an annual turnover of more than 200 crores, Bhavesh's company, Sunrise Candles, enlightens more than 70 countries across the globe. It employees more than 10,000 people all over India at its 71 manufacturing units and more than 4,500 selling units.
                                Good story, eh? But what is the big deal about Bhavesh Bhatia? <br> <br>
                                The big deal is that he is totally blind. 
                                Bhavesh finished his double degree with the help of his mother who read all his books to him. The institute where he learned candle making was, in fact, the National Association for the Blind, Mumbai( NAB). 
                                He was awarded the national award at the hands of the President of India, twice, out of which, one was for being the best employer in the country, which was the best among 58,000 nominations. Out of the 10,000 people he employs, about 9,500 people are blind. 
                                He has won a staggering 114 medals in national Paralympics, and still competes for more. As if that wasn't enough, he became the first ever blind person to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and aspires to be the first blind person to climb Mount Everest. 
                                And that is a pretty big deal! <br> <br>

                                [ Bhavesh sees the world in a way none of us can see. He has a uniquely different perspective on life, a perspective that sits at the far end of the positivity spectrum- something we can emulate. Here's a story he shared with me that illustrates my point:
                                'The turning point of my life came when Baba Ramdev hosted a huge shibir of 40-50,000 people in Mahabaleshwar.'
                                'I went there with my friend to see if I could get a cure to my mother's illness and also, my own. Baba Ramdev was tired telling all these people, “ आँखे बंद करो और अंदर झाँको। आँखे बंद करो और अंदर झाँको।” ( Close your eyes and peek within, close your eyes and peek within.) Then, I heard an inner voice. It said that these people had to try to close their eyes, and even then, they were failing. And here I was, lucky to have been spared of the trouble. “ Treatment तो नही मिला पर मेरा काम हो गया।” ( I didn't get a treatment to our illnesses but I got a cure for my problems.)' ]

                                <p class="card-text">
                                    We'd gone to meet the soul of NAMCO Hospital, Shashikant Parakh. He was in a meeting regarding the construction of a Bone Marrow Transplant unit at the hospital. </p>
                                <p class="card-text read-more-text">
                                    I got to hear a few bits and pieces of it. Shashikant, a commerce graduate, was talking with no less depth of knowledge than a medical professional. He talked loud and clear, and never ever drifted away from the topic.
                                    A management authority, who himself was a doctor, showed us around the hospital. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    The hospital was different from other hospitals in many ways. It didn't have the 'hospital smell'. Instead, it smelled of respect for Shashikant. It's cleanliness was striking and the equipments could've easily put to shame the finest of super speciality hospitals. All this for patients who cannot pay for their treatment. All this because of one man- Shashikant. <br> <br>
                                    'I was born and brought up in the religious town of Shirdi, the town of Sai Baba. We were a joint family and owned a small shop of religious goods in front of a temple.'
                                    Shirdi was, and still is, the destination of pilgrims. But the thing is that the pilgrims don't come to visit Shirdi only. There's a chain of destinations ahead, which is why most of the pilgrims don't stay in Shirdi for more than half a day. This was a brilliant opportunity to develop a lodging business and it took an innovative young chap, like Shashikant, to recognise this. <br> <br>
                                    'There was a 34 room lodging apartment to be rented in Shirdi. I convinced my family to pay the rent and said I would handle the business. They agreed.' 
                                    Shashikant started the hotel in three eight hour shifts. Since the pilgrims didn't need to stay for the whole day, they preferred Shashikant's hotel over others. Immediately, it was a huge success.
                                    'The rent was 1,11,000₹ per year and I managed to earn a sum of 7-8 lakhs in the first year. I was in my first year of college.'
                                    Soon, he'd earned enough to buy another hotel, and soon after, a third one. The business had settled without facing any serious challenges. 
                                    But was he settled? <br> <br>
                                    Nay! A smooth ride isn't his type. He likes a roller coaster filled with challenges. 
                                    'Once the lodging business had settled, I handed it over to my family and said, “ You take care of this business and I, am going to Nashik.”' 
                                    He came to Nashik with no riches and no recognition. He would need to build it again. 
                                    Soon, he started a distribution agency. Once it had settled, he ventured into real estate. Then construction, and then, warehousing. Today, in total, he runs a total of eight businesses, with an annual total turnover of more than a hundred crores, and employees about a hundred people. <br> <br>
                                    'Opportunities येत गेल्या, फायदा घेत गेलो.' ( Opportunities kept on coming, and I kept on grabbing them.)
                                    But a nagging question haunted him: is there an end to all this? And if there's no end, then why expand the business? He stopped expanding it around 2008-09. Now, it was time to use his entrepreneurial skills to help others. That was the biggest challenge.
                                    'I volunteered at a few places before I was given the opportunity to work at NAMCO charitable hospital. <br> <br>
                                    When I joined, NAMCO was totally deteriorated.' The first day after he joined, he called a 'staff meeting.' 
                                    'I said to them, “ I'm the new secretary here and <em>we</em>, are going to transform NAMCO.” They laughed. They literally laughed and said, “ भाऊ, तुमच्यासारखे लई आले आणि लई गेले.” ( We've seen a lot of people like you. You just jabber and do nothing.)'
                                    'When I joined, NAMCO was only treating cancer patients. Bats and rats roamed around. There were only two doctors, both of whom weren't present most of the time. We had thirty beds, out of which, at maximum, only three were occupied.'
                                    This was 2015. Fast forward to 2020, and you'll see an entirely different picture. <br> <br>
                                    'Today, NAMCO is a multi specialty hospital en route to becoming a super speciality hospital with state of the art technology at the cheapest rates. There is a staff of 305, out of which, 40 are highly qualified medical professionals. It now has a total hundred beds with a few patients always in the waiting.'
                                    Still, Shashikant's ambitions for NAMCO run quite high, quite literally.<br> <br>
                                    'I'm going to construct a twelve storey tower with each floor dedicated to each specialty.' He says nonchalantly. <br> <br>
                                    Shashikant's entire life has revolved around one word: challenges. He loves taking up challenges; he thrives when challenged. His life will continue to revolve around that word.
                                    He had taken up the biggest challenge of helping others but he has a wish for a personal challenge as well: Skydiving.
                                    'Skydiving is a dream. I couldn't do it before, but I will do it soon.'
                                    It will not be a surprise then, if he takes a jump out of his steady flight, to take up an entirely new challenge, falling fast towards the destination, with sheer determination to glide to safety. <br> <br>
                                    <strong>Advice to the Youth</strong> <br>
                                    'Dream big. It's as simple as that. Ever since my childhood days, I've always dreamt of becoming the richest man of my town. Dream big but dream with intensity. Only those dreams come true.'
                                    'Keep learning. Be ready to learn. I've always had this mindset- whichever field I'll dabble in, I'll gain a complete knowledge of it. When I started in real estate, I went through a lot of books. When I started working at NAMCO, I studied medical books, which I still do. Have that mindset.'
                                    'And be happy. Success is nothing but happiness. Don't complain. Do whatever you want but be happy.'

                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Rajendra Bagwe, the director of Reliable Autotech, a giant sheet metal manufacturing company, sits in his pretty little cabin, in the Industrial Area of Ambad, Nashik. Just as we entered his cabin, he kept his Amazon Kindle aside- a typical sign of a voracious reader.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text read-more-text">
                                    'My childhood was very simple. I grew up in an environment where a government job, like my Dad's, was thought of as prestigious. As a child, I too wanted to be like my father.' 
                                    Rajendra was born and raised in Mumbai, where he completed his matriculation and his college degree.
                                    'After my matriculation, I got into Jai Hind college, an esteemed junior college at the time. There, I met a lot of rich but humble kids, and that stirred something. I started thinking, “ Rich doesn't necessarily mean spoiled, as was the common belief. I, too, can be rich and like them.” So there! There I started deviating from the conventional mould, you know, get good grades, then a job, then get married, and your life is all set. The Jai Hind College made me think differently.' <br><br>
                                    This different thinking led him to dabble in business in his engineering years. 
                                    'Me and my two friends, Devendra Bapat and Amol Chitnis, started thinking that we should get some business experience.'
                                    Each of them had a relative who ran a business. They all asked for jobs and worked in those businesses for a while. Soon enough, they realised that business means manufacturing, and manufacturing requires space. ( In those days, there weren't any software companies. So there wasn't the concept of 'offices'. There were only workshops.)
                                    After their graduation, all three landed jobs easily. Rajendra took up a job in Mahindra. But the trio wanted to do something different. Something out of the mould. <br><br>
                                    'We used to meet after our jobs in a park and discuss our ideas. But we didn't know what exactly we wanted to do. We just knew we wanted to do business and doing business meant we'd need space. So we just sent an application to MIDC( Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation) stating that we required a piece of land to start our business.' 
                                    A year later, a letter came from the MIDC. MIDC was allocating them a plot of land. They were surprised to see the letter- the trio had forgotten about their application! <br><br>
                                    MIDC had offered them a choice- either a plot at Ambernath or a plot in Nashik.
                                    'The plot in Ambarnath was out of our pocket's reach, so we came to Nasik. Till then, we didn't even know where Nashik was.' They came, but did they conquer?  <br><br>
                                    Not so fast!
                                    The MIDC officer in Nashik said that they didn't have any plots to offer! They showed him the letter but to no avail. Luckily again, the trio had a friend who knew how to 'manage' such officers, which he did. The officer, then, showed them four plots.
                                    'We were inexperienced enough to know nothing about property. So we just pointed to a plot and said, “ We want that one.” He said okay but asked us to pay 18,000₹  immediately.'
                                    They had saved enough stipend from their jobs to buy the plot. They bought it. Still, they had no idea what to do in that plot!
                                    'We went back to Mumbai, got busy with our jobs, and conveniently forgot about our plot.'
                                    A year later, MIDC reminded them again. <br><br>
                                    'We received a notice, saying that if we didn't construct anything on the plot, it'll be sealed.' 
                                    By then, the three of them had collectively saved a decent sum of 1 lakh Rupees.
                                    'We had 1 lakh and we took a loan of 2 lakh rupees, to construct a tiny little building of a thousand sq.ft.' 
                                    Surely now they knew what they were doing, right? Nope, they still didn't know why they'd constructed the building! Still, they didn't know what business they were going to do. The only thing they knew was that they'd do something related with engineering. So they named the company 'Reliable Engineers'. <br><br>
                                    Meanwhile, Rajendra was transferred to Nashik. Now, he would be close to their 'company.' 
                                    'I told my boss at Mahindra that I wanted to quit and start my own business. I asked him to give us business. He agreed. He talked to a company called Spicer India in giving us business.' 
                                    'Spicer gave us a job of dismantling rejected clutch plates and asked us if we'd do it.'
                                    Basically, the job was to sort out reusable waste from non reusable waste of the automotive industry. But they never said no. <br><br>
                                    'We said we'd do it, which we did. After that, they asked if we'd make washers. We said we'd do that too, which we did. Then, a relationship started.'
                                    One such enquiry from Spicer India was to make a spring, which, again the trio said yes to. Little did they know how tough a challenge it was going to be.
                                    'We struggled for six hard months. In these six months, we learned many elements of engineering- real engineering- something very different from our college education. Finally, we made it. In fact, before us, Spicer India was taking that very same spring from Germany at a cost of 8 Rupees a piece. We did it in 1.8 Rupees, and the quality just as good as the Germans.'
                                    Then the reliability of the Reliable Engineers grew and a lot of business started coming from Spicer. 
                                    'We did any work we were offered and then somewhere along the road, we decided a direction that we are going to do sheet metal pressing.'
                                    Their direction was set, and this time, even fortune favored them. <br><br>
                                    Till then, Mahindra & Mahindra was doing all the sheet metal pressing, but it now decided that they want to offload it to suppliers, which meant that the field was open. He who grabbed the chance, had tremendous opportunity for growth. Speed was what mattered, and speed was what they had. 
                                    'We knew that if we wanted to grow our business, we'd need bigger and better machinery. To buy it, I went abroad for the first time and landed in Germany.'
                                    The Germans were honest in their deal. They showed him the machines in and out.
                                    'I knew nothing about machines either. The Germans said, “ We have three machines to offer. Which one do you want?” I simply pointed my finger to one and said, “ I want that one.”' 
                                    It was a ridiculously big gamble. The total cost of the machine, and that too, of a 50 year old machine, was more than their annual turnover. 
                                    'आता विचार केला, तर तो अक्षरश: वेडेपणा वाटतो.' ( It seems madness if we think about it now.)
                                    Had the machine not worked, they were doomed. Luckily, it worked, but not without a twist. <br><br>
                                    'The machine was HUGE. It was supposed to come in nine containers. Eight came, one didn't. It got stuck somewhere in the western ghats. We somehow got it back, assembled the machine, and it worked. It worked! I'll never forget the relief when the machine first made some noise, any noise!'
                                    From then on, Reliable Autotech has slowly but surely conquered the market of sheet metal pressing. <br><br>
                                    Today, they are amongst the top five manufacturers in the country with more than a thousand employees at seven locations, and a turnover of more than 600 crore Rupees per year.
                                    Rajendra's story appears lucky. But he was not lucky- he was brave. Brave enough to stay the course, to execute, and to allow luck to present itself. We too, can be as lucky as Rajendra, but we have to be brave like him. We have to dare to take the risk of execution. And life rewards not those who dare to plan but those who dare to execute, even if they're without a plan. And Rajendra did dare to execute! <br><br>
                                    
                                    <strong>Advice for the youth:</strong><br>
                                    'We grew because we took risks. I mean, risk was the main theme for us. So, take risks.' He chuckles. 'You know, even risk taking has a formula. Knowledge/ ignorance= Risk. The closer you get the ratio to 1:1, the smaller the risk. Minimize the risks, but take them.' 
                                    'Do what you like, yaar. And try to get better each day. Success means nothing but a step towards your goal. Set goals and try to inch your way closer each day. That's it.' <br> <br>
