    "text": "Background\nDad, a schizophrenic, with a minuscule salary of ‚Çπ700 per month; mom, a cancer patient; elder brother, deceased from a dog bite reaction; home at a place which was dominated by Naxalite activities, Gondia. With this as his background, came the light of the Bhatia family‚ÄîBhavesh.\n Photo With Bhavesh Bhatia\n\n\nHis Story\nBhavesh‚Äôs childhood was a continuous struggle. Yet, he had a hankering for adventures.\n\n‚Äú‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á adventures ‡§™‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ (I love adventures.) In the 8th grade, I made a friend who had an amputated leg. After finishing our 10th grade, we made a trip from our hometown to Kathmandu, Nepal‚Äîa distance of 5,620 km‚Äîon a bicycle. I had to do the pedalling. He had to do the handling.‚Äù\n\nAnd together, they managed their ride. The trip was to make an identity of his own, to prove himself to the world. He did prove himself. He was welcomed like a hero in his hometown.\n\n‚Äú‡§ó‡§æ‡§Å‡§µ‡§∏‡•á ‡•®‡•¶-‡•©‡•¶ km ‡§¨‡§æ‡§π‡§∞, ‡•™‡•¶‡•¶-‡•´‡•¶‡•¶ ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó welcome ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§Ü‡§è ‡§•‡•á‡•§ (There were 400-500 people outside my town to welcome me.)‚Äù\n\nBut the euphoria of success didn‚Äôt last long.\nSoon after returning, his mother was taken seriously ill with stage IV blood cancer.\n\n‚Äú‡§ò‡§∞, ‡§ú‡§º‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§®, ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§ö‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ, ‡§∏‡§¨ ‡§¨‡•á‡§ö ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ ‡§¶‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ã‡§Ç, ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ú‡§ø‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§â‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§º‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§º‡§æ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ (We sold everything we had and took out as much loan as we could for her treatment.) But fate operates on her own accord. We lost her, regardless of our efforts.‚Äù\n\nBereft of a great loving support, left alone with a relapsed dad, he was now an unemployed double graduate. This is how Bhavesh‚Äôs life stood in the early 1990s.\n\n‚Äú‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å ‡§ö‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§Ø‡•Ä, ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ daddy ‡§¨‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡•Å‡§≤ footpath ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Ü ‡§ó‡§è‡•§ (Mom left us, but me and dad were on the streets.)‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI had a master‚Äôs degree in Psychology and Economics, yet I was without a job. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt want to do a job; I wanted to do business. But what business could I do back then? There was none. I had to find a job. I worked as a telephone operator for a while, 18-20 hours a day for a handful of coins. Later, I got trained as a massage therapist. In fact, I was awarded ‚ÄòThe Best Massage Therapist in Maharashtra‚Äô award. I worked day and night; I worked till my hands were swollen and somehow managed to save ‚Çπ5,000.‚Äù\nThese hard-earned ‚Çπ5,000 were put to the best use possible.\nBhavesh learned a skill‚Äîcandle making‚Äîa skill that would transform his life. With the ‚Çπ5,000, he bought 20 kg of wax and a simple candle die for raw material. Thus, he embarked on his dream of starting a business. His manufacturing unit? A single wooden table. His retail store? A rented handcart. The name registered‚ÄîSunrise Candles. The year was 1994 and the place, Mahabaleshwar.\n\n‚ÄúBack in the day, candles worth thousands of crores were imported from countries like China. Even today, the scenario hasn‚Äôt changed much. It was obvious that there was a tremendous opportunity in the candle business, especially in the ‚Äòfancy‚Äô candle business. And Mahabaleshwar, being a tourist destination, played to my advantage.‚Äù\n\nBhavesh‚Äôs mornings became reserved for manufacturing candles and his evenings, for selling them. He started with plain candles but soon, he was designing fancy candles. Within the first few years, he had created thousands of beautiful designs.\n\n‚ÄúPeople used to come to my handcart and fall in love with what I was doing. They would buy a few candles, and then send more people to my handcart. On my handcart came tourists who were specialists in business. They helped me with marketing, packaging, sales, and whatnot. The business grew in this way.‚Äù\n\nYet, there was the sword of debt hanging over his head.\n\n‚ÄúWe knew that if we wanted to expand, we had to reach outside Mahabaleshwar. So we started taking part in exhibitions. At one such exhibition, there came a couple who worked at Infosys. It was their wedding anniversary. I gave them a small gift from my side. They were so impressed that they invited me to stay at Infosys for three days and mailed all the 25,000 employees of Infosys to encourage them to buy my products.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs miraculous what a small act of kindness can do. A ‚Çπ60 gift brought in a business of ‚Çπ23 lakhs. The whole debt was paid off, with interest.\nBy now, Bhavesh was employing about 30 people. The production was now far exceeding the selling capacity of a handcart. He had to find more places to sell his candles. Again, the tourism value of Mahabaleshwar came to the rescue.\n\n‚ÄúA few hoteliers were now willing to put up a small selling unit of ours at their hotels. By now, even we‚Äôd understood where we should sell the candles, you know, tourist places and such. We put up our stall wherever we got the opportunity and the whole ownership of the stall was given to the guy running it. We could expand even more in this way. More than a thousand corporates are now associated with us including the Taj Group and Grand Hyatt Group.‚Äù\n\nHis business now ran smoothly. Yet, the hunger for adventures wouldn‚Äôt let him sit still. He took up mountaineering.\n\n‚Äú‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä trekking ‡§µ‡§ó‡•à‡§∞‡•á ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã, ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ü‡§ì ‡§π‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§•‡•§ (If you want to go on a trek, join us.) I have just finished climbing Kilimanjaro, and my dream is to climb Mount Everest. It‚Äôs, like, a real bucket list item.‚Äù\n\nWith an annual turnover of more than ‚Çπ200 crores, Bhavesh‚Äôs company, Sunrise Candles, enlightens more than 70 countries across the globe. It employs more than 10,000 people all over India at its 71 manufacturing units and more than 4,500 selling units.\nGood story, eh? But what is the big deal about Bhavesh Bhatia?\nThe big deal is that he is totally blind.\nBhavesh finished his double degree with the help of his mother who read all his books to him. The institute where he learned candle making was, in fact, the National Association for the Blind, Mumbai (NAB).\nHe was awarded the national award at the hands of the President of India, twice, out of which, one was for being the best employer in the country, which was the best among 58,000 nominations. Out of the 10,000 people he employs, about 9,500 people are blind.\nHe has won a staggering 114 medals in national Paralympics, and still competes for more. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, he became the first-ever blind person to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and aspires to be the first blind person to climb Mount Everest.\nAnd that is a pretty big deal!\n\n\n\nAdvice to the Youth:\n\n‚ÄúNever tell your destinations where your problems are. Tell your problems where your destinations are.‚Äù\n‚ÄúSuccess is nothing but being able to sleep well at night. Do whatever you want but never do anything that‚Äôll take away your night‚Äôs good sleep.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt wait. Each day is the best day to start doing what you want to do. Just start doing it.‚Äù\n\n\nBhavesh sees the world in a way none of us can see. He has a uniquely different perspective on life, a perspective that sits at the far end of the positivity spectrum‚Äîsomething we can emulate. Here‚Äôs a story he shared with me that illustrates my point:\n\n‚ÄúThe turning point of my life came when Baba Ramdev hosted a huge shibir of 40-50,000 people in Mahabaleshwar.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúI went there with my friend to see if I could get a cure to my mother‚Äôs illness and also, my own. Baba Ramdev was tired telling all these people, ‚Äú‡§Ü‡§Å‡§ñ‡•á ‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§¶‡§∞ ‡§ù‡§æ‡§Å‡§ï‡•ã‡•§ ‡§Ü‡§Å‡§ñ‡•á ‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§¶‡§∞ ‡§ù‡§æ‡§Å‡§ï‡•ã‡•§‚Äù (Close your eyes and peek within, close your eyes and peek within.) Then, I heard an inner voice. It said that these people had to try to close their eyes, and even then, they were failing. And here I was, lucky to have been spared of the trouble. ‚ÄúTreatment ‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§‚Äù (I didn‚Äôt get a treatment to our illnesses but I got a cure for my problems.)‚Äù"

    "text": "Recently, I came across Vishy Anand‚Äôs book- ‚ÄúMind Master‚Äù. For anyone who admires Vishy, and anyone who wants to succeed in life, the book is a delight. Vishy shares his experiences and the lessons he learned from playing chess. In this post, I share the top three lessons from Vishy‚Äôs book.\nThose who want to read the book can buy it here.\n1. Don‚Äôt Obssess About Your Progress\nIt is important to keep track of your progress, but it‚Äôs not at all helpful to obsess over how far you‚Äôve come. Sometimes, it feels like you‚Äôre getting nowhere, and then, out of nowhere, situations may change and you may achieve your goals within a week.\nFor Vishy, it took seemingly forever to get his grandmaster norms. He missed out on the norms by the smallest margins- as small as half a point. He got frustrated and impatient. He was so close to achieving a goal he had worked so hard for. Fortunately, he had mentors and friends to support him through the journey. This slump was definitely difficult, but when he did get the norms, he earned all the three within a span of just a year!\nIf you‚Äôre feeling like you‚Äôre getting nowhere, that‚Äôs totally fine! If you‚Äôre not finding a job, that‚Äôs okay! If you‚Äôre finding it hard to master deep learning, that‚Äôs also alright! The key is to not obsess over your progress but to be tenacious. Have someone to support you. Who knows, the tides may turn within a week!\n2. What Should You Do After You Achieve Your Goals?\nOnce Vishy realized that he wanted to become a grandmaster, he spent all his energy into the pursuit of achieving that goal. Becoming a grandmaster is what gave his life meaning. But what happened after he became grandmaster?\nVishy says, his life was empty. There was no meaning left once he‚Äôd achieved his goal. You may be surprised, but Vishy wasn‚Äôt the exception. Most grandmasters feel this way once they become GMs.\nSome of us may be fortunate enough to achieve our goals, but some of us may not be- we may have to quit. Then, it‚Äôs all too easy to fall into the trap of despising ourselves for wasting efforts and time. It‚Äôs all too easy to not find the purpose of life.\nBut we need to put our trust in time. For Vishy, it took him six months to get back to being excited about life. With time, we will get over this void and move on. But during this time, perhaps we take up a hobby, travel, or do something that we always wanted to do.\n3. Will AI Take My Job?\nFor so long, brilliant chess was solely human feat. Grandmasters in the olden days relied on nothing but their effort and intellect. With time, computers started beating chess players. Now, no chess grandmaster prepares without using a chess engine.\nChess witnessed the rise of AI. Vishy is perhaps the only person to have played in all three eras of chess. He saw what AI can do and how AI can impact us. Of course, Vishy has some advice for all of us.\nWe cannot deny the rise of AI. It‚Äôs definitely going to change things. As professionals, it‚Äôs up to us to adapt, learn, and unlearn. The way Vishy sees it, his work begins where AI‚Äôs work ends. The job of an engine is to study the positions and come up with analyses and conclusions. Once the conclusions are ready, it‚Äôs when Vishy‚Äôs job starts. He needs to understand why the conclusions make sense and then use those conclusions to enhance his understanding of his game.\nThere‚Äôs an open interpretation here- if we want, we can apply the same reasoning to any other field, and not just Chess. Is AI going to take over software developer jobs? It‚Äôs definitely going to change them. Those who can adapt can brilliantly make use of AI‚Äôs power to do their jobs better.\nRegardless of whether AI takes over or not, it‚Äôs certainly our duty to be adaptable. Always be asking ourselves the questions: What do I need to learn? What do I need to unlearn?\n\n\n\nMind Master By Vishy"
