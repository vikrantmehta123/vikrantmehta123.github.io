    "text": "Recently, I came across Vishy Anand‚Äôs book- ‚ÄúMind Master‚Äù. For anyone who admires Vishy, and anyone who wants to succeed in life, the book is a delight. Vishy shares his experiences and the lessons he learned from playing chess. In this post, I share the top three lessons from Vishy‚Äôs book.\nThose who want to read the book can buy it here.\n1. Don‚Äôt Obssess About Your Progress\nIt is important to keep track of your progress, but it‚Äôs not at all helpful to obsess over how far you‚Äôve come. Sometimes, it feels like you‚Äôre getting nowhere, and then, out of nowhere, situations may change and you may achieve your goals within a week.\nFor Vishy, it took seemingly forever to get his grandmaster norms. He missed out on the norms by the smallest margins- as small as half a point. He got frustrated and impatient. He was so close to achieving a goal he had worked so hard for. Fortunately, he had mentors and friends to support him through the journey. This slump was definitely difficult, but when he did get the norms, he earned all the three within a span of just a year!\nIf you‚Äôre feeling like you‚Äôre getting nowhere, that‚Äôs totally fine! If you‚Äôre not finding a job, that‚Äôs okay! If you‚Äôre finding it hard to master deep learning, that‚Äôs also alright! The key is to not obsess over your progress but to be tenacious. Have someone to support you. Who knows, the tides may turn within a week!\n2. What Should You Do After You Achieve Your Goals?\nOnce Vishy realized that he wanted to become a grandmaster, he spent all his energy into the pursuit of achieving that goal. Becoming a grandmaster is what gave his life meaning. But what happened after he became grandmaster?\nVishy says, his life was empty. There was no meaning left once he‚Äôd achieved his goal. You may be surprised, but Vishy wasn‚Äôt the exception. Most grandmasters feel this way once they become GMs.\nSome of us may be fortunate enough to achieve our goals, but some of us may not be- we may have to quit. Then, it‚Äôs all too easy to fall into the trap of despising ourselves for wasting efforts and time. It‚Äôs all too easy to not find the purpose of life.\nBut we need to put our trust in time. For Vishy, it took him six months to get back to being excited about life. With time, we will get over this void and move on. But during this time, perhaps we take up a hobby, travel, or do something that we always wanted to do.\n3. Will AI Take My Job?\nFor so long, brilliant chess was solely human feat. Grandmasters in the olden days relied on nothing but their effort and intellect. With time, computers started beating chess players. Now, no chess grandmaster prepares without using a chess engine.\nChess witnessed the rise of AI. Vishy is perhaps the only person to have played in all three eras of chess. He saw what AI can do and how AI can impact us. Of course, Vishy has some advice for all of us.\nWe cannot deny the rise of AI. It‚Äôs definitely going to change things. As professionals, it‚Äôs up to us to adapt, learn, and unlearn. The way Vishy sees it, his work begins where AI‚Äôs work ends. The job of an engine is to study the positions and come up with analyses and conclusions. Once the conclusions are ready, it‚Äôs when Vishy‚Äôs job starts. He needs to understand why the conclusions make sense and then use those conclusions to enhance his understanding of his game.\nThere‚Äôs an open interpretation here- if we want, we can apply the same reasoning to any other field, and not just Chess. Is AI going to take over software developer jobs? It‚Äôs definitely going to change them. Those who can adapt can brilliantly make use of AI‚Äôs power to do their jobs better.\nRegardless of whether AI takes over or not, it‚Äôs certainly our duty to be adaptable. Always be asking ourselves the questions: What do I need to learn? What do I need to unlearn?\n\n\n\nMind Master by Vishy Anand"
