### Project Overview

I was always confused about what a "protocol" is and how HTTP actually works. In our application development courses, we used Flask to make web apps, and starting a server was super easyâ€”just a couple of commands. Same with sessions- it was very easy to do, but I never *understood* it. This confused me to no end: what the hell was *really* happening behind those commands!?  So I decided to build an HTTP server from scratch to satisfy this curiosity. 

This project is a simple HTTP server built using Python from the ground up without relying on existing frameworks, except the low-level networking libraries. It's built to explore what servers do, how HTTP works, and how do  sessions work.

### Features

- An extensible router that lets you add routes and route-handlers
- Sessions and Token management
- Request parser and response formatter
- Logging for debugging and maintenance perspective
- An OOP based design for the server

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python

- **Modules**: `socket` (for low-level networking), and other built-in libraries like `hashlib`, `logging`, and `threading`
