### Project Overview

In this project, I wanted to peel away one layer of abstraction from the way we use programming languages. Instead of writing code in Python and not worrying about anything below that, I want to go one step lower and figure out what happens under-the-hood. In this project, I wrote a parser that uses Python to parse a Logstash pipeline into a neat Abstract Syntax Tree objects.

[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) is an open-source data processing pipeline that is commonly used to parse logs. Logstash pipelines have a specific structure where the users can define inputs, outputs, and the processing filters. The parser parses a logstash file and constructs an easily-traversable Abstract Syntax Tree for the pipeline. This tree can then be manipulated, analyzed, and improved as user desires.

For the purposes of this project, I focused only on the [Filter plugins](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/logstash/plugins/filter-plugins). 

### Features

- Logstash syntax can be easily accessed and manipulated through Python objects such as `Plugin`, `Expression`, etc.
- Each object has a method `to_logstash` which reconstructs the corresponding logstash configuration based on the AST.

### Tech Stack
