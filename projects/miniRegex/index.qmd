description: "A fully functional regular expression engine built from scratch in Python, featuring recursive descent parsing and backtracking search."

### Project Overview

During my work at VuNet Systems, I frequently worked with Regular Expressions, which sparked my curiosity about how regex engines actually work under the hood.

To understand the theory behind regular languages and parsing algorithms, I self-studied online courses on Theory of Computation and Compilers. Armed with this knowledge, I built a complete regex engine from scratch in Python—without using Python's built-in `re` module.

The engine supports all fundamental regex syntax including quantifiers (both greedy and lazy), character classes, capture groups, anchors, and alternation. It implements a recursive descent parser to convert regex patterns into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), followed by a backtracking matcher for pattern matching. The architecture roughly follows Java's `java.util.regex` module.

### Key Features

- **Complete Parsing Pipeline**: Recursive descent parser that converts regex patterns into an AST representation
- **Advanced Quantifiers**: Support for `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n,m}` with both greedy and lazy variants
- **Character Classes**: Including ranges `[a-z]`, negation `[^abc]`, and shortcuts like `\d`, `\w`, `\s`
- **Capture Groups**: Regular `(...)`, non-capturing `(?:...)`, and named groups `(?<name>...)`
- **Anchors**: Position assertions with `^`, `$`, `\b`, `\B`

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python

### Limitations & Future Work

While functional for educational purposes, the engine lacks some advanced features like lookahead/lookbehind assertions and backreferences. Future enhancements could include NFA/DFA compilation for improved performance and an interactive regex debugger.
