### Project Overview

I enjoy building things from scratch. In this project, I tried to build the Wavenet like architecture for a language modeling task from scratch. For the most part, I tried to follow Andrej Karpathy's Tutorial on YouTube, along with certain additional notes that I took along the way to understand PyTorch's broadcasting and batched matrix multiplication.

In this Jupyter notebook, I trained a character level language model that predicts the next character based on a context of eight characters. I implemented the neural network modules from scratch, without using PyTorch, except for tensor operations. In this architecture, the flatten layers hierarchically fuse character embeddings along the layers and achieve a decent loss. 

The dataset used for the project is a names dataset, which was what was used in the YouTube tutorial as well. 

### Tech Stack Used
1. Python Jupyter Notebooks
