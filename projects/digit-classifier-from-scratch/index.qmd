### Project Overview

MNIST dataset is the one of the first datasets that you come across in your deep learning journey. In this project, we build a classifier for digits using the MNIST dataset. We build a simple model first, and then see how we can improve this model. We'll also pass in custom images that we draw ourselves and see how our model performs on them as well!
