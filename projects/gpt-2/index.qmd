### Project Overview

In this project, I tried to implement the GPT-2 architecture from scratch using PyTorch. I trained the model using the FineWeb_Edu dataset, and evaluated using the Hellaswag dataset. 

For training, I rented a few Lambda Labs GPUs.

I relied heavily on Andrej Karpathy's tutorial and Mitesh Khapra Sir's lectures to understand the internals of GPT-2 better. 

### Tech Stack
