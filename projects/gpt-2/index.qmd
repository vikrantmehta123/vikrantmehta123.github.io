### Project Overview

In this project, I tried to implement the full GPT-2 architecture from scratch using PyTorch. I pretrained the model using the *FineWeb_Edu* dataset. The model is an implementation and an improvement on the GPT-2 124M model.

I relied heavily on Andrej Karpathy's tutorial and Mitesh Khapra Sir's lectures to understand the internals of GPT-2 better. 

### Tech Stack
